# Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE)

<h3 align="center" style="margin-top:-10px">Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE) is an open-source visual analytics tool for exploring social vulnerability across different neighborhoods</h3> 

VNE is a cyberGIS-based visual analytics tool that allows users to (1) delineate neighborhoods based on their selection of variables describing socioeconomic and demographic profiles and (2) explore which neighborhoods are susceptible to the impacts of disasters based on specific socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/download) is the recommended web browser for reaping the best performance of VNE.

<h2 id="Getting-Started"> Getting Started</h2>
**You can run VNE in your Jupyter Notebook/Lab installed on your PC as well as in CybearGISX. We recommend that you use CyberGISX because all the required packages have been integrated in CyberGISX.**<br/><br/>

**To use it in CyberGISX, follow steps below:**
1. If you do not have a CyerGISX account, create a CyberGISX account with your institution's email address or Google email address at  [https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu)
2. Once you log in CyberGISX, go to [https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/vulnerable-neighborhood-explorer](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/vulnerable-neighborhood-explorer), and click the button "Open with CyberGISX".  Wait for 3 to 5 seconds. All related source codes will be automatically copied, and the main notebook will be opened. Then, click the “play button” at the top to run.

<h2 id="Case">A Case Study</h2>

Exploring Neighborhood-level Social Vulnerability to COVID-19 in Chicago. 

Two images (Fig 1 and 2) below show the result visualization of VNE, which allow users to explore socioeconomic and demographic disparity in COVID-19 outbreaks as well as vulnerable neighborhoods and their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Two input data were used: 
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 confirmed and test cases at the zip code level in Chicago. They were downloaded from the website of the Illinois Department of Public Health. The data used reflects the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak until July 11th, 2020, when the data was downloaded.</li> 

<li> American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates from 2014 to 2018. From ACS, 18 variables representing different socioeconomic and demographic statuses were collected.</li>
</ul>


Below is a detailed description of each chart and map that can be visualized using the Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE).

- In __Fig1-A2__, users can select disaster-related data via a dropdown menu, choosing between total infection rates or rates categorized by race/ethnicity (e.g., White, Hispanic) at Zip Codes outlined in white. __Fig1-A1__ displays the density distribution of the selected data, providing geographic context

- __Fig1-A3__ presents neighborhood delineations obtained through k-means clustering of the eighteen American Community Survey variables at the census Zip Code level (as labeled on the x-axis in __Fig 2A__). Each neighborhood typically comprises multiple Zip Codes.

- The right side of  __Fig1-A3__  shows the proportion of Zip Codes in each cluster, serving as a legend. Clusters include "White Rich Owner," "White Hispanic Aging Suburban," "Asian Elite Renter," "Hispanic Laborer," and "Black Poor." Users can name each cluster by analyzing the Z-score means of the variables using the heatmap and bar charts in  __Fig 2A and 2B__. This can be updated in Config.js by clicking the third link generated by VNE. For labeling instructions, see [*Han et al., 2023*].

- __Fig1 B1-B3__ displays column charts showing the total infection rate, testing rate, and confirmed rate for each neighborhood, respectively.

- __Fig1 C1-C3__ complement these with box plots showing the distribution of these rates across the five clusters. 

- __Fig 2A and 2B__ illustrate the mean z-scores of each input variable, highlighting the distinguishing characteristics of the clusters in __Fig1-A3__.  Z-scores indicate how far each variable's value is from the mean. 

  - __Fig 2A__ compares the mean z-scores of the eighteen variables across the five neighborhoods.
  - __Fig 2B__ shows the sorted mean z-score for a selected neighborhood which can be chosen using the dropdown box at the top of this chart. In this case, five horizontal bar charts representing the mean z-score of each of the eighteen variables can be created on the interface of the interactive map.

<h2 id="Interactive">Interactive Features of the Visual Interface</h2>
VNE is a geovisual analytics tool that utilizes a Coordinated Multiple Views (CMV) approach, allowing users to interact with several interconnected visual representations simultaneously. This enhances the analysis of complex data relationships and facilitates the extraction of meaningful insights. 

A key feature of CMV is cross-filtering, where actions in one view—such as selecting a region in a chart—automatically update related views. For instance, consider three visualizations: a map showing COVID-19 infection rates by Zip Code (__Fig 3B__), a map displaying different neighborhood types (__Fig 6C__), and a proportion chart of Zip Code areas per neighborhood (__Fig 3D__). When a user hovers over a neighborhood category in the proportion chart, both maps update to reflect the selected area. Hovering over "C0 White Rich Owner" highlights the data in this neighborhood on both maps, showing a generally low infection rate (__Fig 1A, B and C__). Conversely, hovering over "C4 Black Poor" highlights that neighborhood, indicating a higher infection rate (__Fig 1D, E and F__). This interactive cross-filtering enables users to compare infection rates across neighborhoods, focus on specific areas to identify localized trends, and understand how different neighborhoods relate to infection rates. In summary, VNE's CMV and cross-filtering capabilities allow for dynamic exploration and analysis of disaster-related data, such as COVID-19 infection rates, across different neighborhoods.

Figure 3. Partial visualization of the VNE output. Panels (A) and (B) show the map view when the C0: White Rich Owner neighborhood is selected in the proportion chart (C). Panels (D) and (E) show the map view when the C4: Black Poor neighborhood is selected in the proportion chart (F). 

Another key feature of VNE is brushing, where highlighting a specific data point in one visualization, simultaneously highlighting the corresponding regions across all linked maps. On the right in __Fig 4__, the box plot depicts the distribution of COVID-19 infection rates across five neighborhoods, with each dot representing the infection rate of a specific Zip Code area. Users can lasso-select these dots (Zip Codes) on the chart, triggering the corresponding Zip Code areas to be highlighted on the two maps. In this example, the box plot focuses on the Hispanic laborer neighborhood, revealing a higher distribution of infection rates compared to other neighborhoods. By selecting areas above the 75th percentile within this neighborhood, the highlighted Zip Code areas represent the top 25% of infection rates in the Hispanic laborer neighborhood.


Figure 4. The result visualization is created by setting only the box plots to 1 and leaving the other chart options unselected.

VNE integrates synchronized map views with cross-filtering capabilities to enhance data exploration. When a user pans or zooms one map, all linked maps automatically adjust to display the same geographic area. This synchronization enables simultaneous analysis of COVID-19 infection rates and neighborhood types within focused regions. Additionally, zooming into a sub-region on the maps triggers the distribution chart to dynamically display the infection rate distribution within the current map boundaries. Furthermore, the chart illustrated in __Fig 5D__ updates in real-time to show the proportion of polygons within each neighborhood. __Fig 5__ presents maps of a region that has been zoomed in from __Fig 1-A1, A2, and A3__. Please note that the distribution charts (__Fig 5A__ ) and the proportion chart (__Fig 5D__ ) appear differently in these figures, reflecting the views before and after zooming. Specifically, C2: Asian Elite Rent is not displayed in __Fig 5D__ because the zoomed-in map in __Fig 5  B and C__ no longer includes this neighborhood once zoomed from the view shown in __Fig1-A2 &A3__.

Figure 5. Partial visualization of the VNE output. (A) illustrates the distribution of the variable selected in (B), where (B) represents the COVID-19 infection rate. (C) and (D) depict neighborhood types. These images are screen captures taken from the visualization featured in the accompanying video.
