# Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE)

#### GEOSNAP needs to be installed to run VNE.
geosnap development is hosted on [github](https://github.com/spatialucr/geosnap)
To get started with the development version,
clone this repository or download it manually then `cd` into the directory and run the
following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geosnap 
python setup.py develop
```
This will download the appropriate dependencies and install geosnap in its own conda environment.
After the installation above is done run VNE in the geosnap environment. 

### How to run:
- Script: python VulnerableNeighborhoodExplorer.py
- Jupyter notebook: VNE_with_Source_Code.ipynb
