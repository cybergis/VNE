# Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE)

<h2 align="center" style="margin-top:-10px">Vulnerable Neighborhood Explorer (VNE) is an open-source visual analytics tool for exploring social vulnerability across different neighborhoods.</h2> 
<br/>


VNE is a cyberGIS-based visual analytics tool that allows users to (1) delineate neighborhoods based on their selection of variables describing socioeconomic and demographic profiles and (2) explore which neighborhoods are susceptible to the impacts of disasters based on specific socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/download) is the recommended web browser for reaping the best performance of VNE

## QuickStart

**Example visaulizations are available in the folders below:**<br/>
*	VNE_Chicago_kmeans_C5 <br/>
*	New_York_kmeans_C5<br/>
*	Phoenix_kmeans_C5<br/>
*	Miami_kmeans_C5<br/>
*	US_kmeans_C5<br/>
*	Chicago_extended_kmeans_C5<br/>
*	Illinois_kmeans_C5 <br/>

## Getting Started
**You can run VNE in your Jupyter Notebook installed on your PC as well as in CybearGISX. We recommend that you use CyberGISX because all the required packages have been integrated in CyberGISX.**<br/><br/>

**To use it in CyberGISX, follow steps below:**
1. If you do not have a CyerGISX account, create a CyberGISX account with your institution's email address or Google email address at  [https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu)
2. Once you log in CyberGISX, go to [https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/vulnerable-neighborhood-explorer](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/vulnerable-neighborhood-explorer), and click the button "Open with CyberGISX".  Wait for 3 to 5 seconds. All related source codes will be automatically copied, and the main notebook will be opened. Then, click the “play button” at the top to run.
